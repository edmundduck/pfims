        You may have loads of investment statements from different brokers. When do you need to review them all in one go? Possibly during tax reporting season.

        PFIMS can group all brokers' investment profit and loss into the same interface for you to understand how the investment is performing. Of course it also helps tax reporting by getting an overall profit and loss in one tax reporting year.

        Do you often "feel like" your expense is not that much, but turnout you are shocked by the actual figure? Is that common for you to lose track of the expense like this?

        To grasp your financial condition, PFIMS can help you store all the expense transaction or income detail by uploading your bank statements or input manually. For further analysis, categorize transactions under different labels and generate charts.
